# RPS-NodeJs
<h1>Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors</h1>

Meet a very simple 2 players <i>rock paper scissors</i> game in nodejs. To make this work you will need Nodejs installed but also the password-prompt module.
You shouldn't need to install it since it's in the folder. Simply download the zip, uncompress it, position yourself in it with the terminal and lunch the program with the commande:
<i>node app.js</i>
There are a few different versions of this program: the very simple version called "v1" and "v2" and a little more completed version called "app" that gives the ability to write your names, hides the moves from the players to prevent cheating and give the users a more typos proof interface. 

<h3>Complete version: </h3>

Here is the welcome menu, where you can both type your names, then make you're moves:
